Responsive Navigation CSS & JS

This code snippet provides a sample responsive navigation. It uses HTML, CSS and some JS.

Main features:
- Mobile-first responsive navigation
- Animated navicon to show / hide the mobile navigation items
- Desktop sample with dropdown functionality

Responsive Breakpoints are inline with Bootstrap 3:
- 0 (xs)
- 768px+ (sm)
- 992px + (md)
- 1200px + (lg)

Dependencies:
- jQuery

Considerations / Notes:
- The CSS will need to get tweaked once the links are updated, as the length of the words can affect the layout.
- There are some additional CSS such as utility classes and font styles. This can get edited as necessary.
